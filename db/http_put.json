    "description": "\nThere are various methods in which a file (or files) may be uploaded to a\nwebserver. One method that can be used is the HTTP `PUT` method. The `PUT`\nmethod is mainly used during development of applications and allows developers to\nupload (or put) files on the server within the web root.\n\nBy nature of the design, the `PUT` method typically does not provide any filtering\nand therefore allows sever side executable code (PHP, ASP, etc) to be uploaded to\nthe server.\n\nCyber-criminals will search for servers supporting the `PUT` method with the\nintention of modifying existing pages, or uploading web shells to take control\nof the server.\n\nThe tool has discovered that the affected path allows clients to use the `PUT`\nmethod. During this test, The tool has `PUT` a file on the server within the web\nroot and successfully performed a `GET` request to its location and verified the\ncontents.\n",
