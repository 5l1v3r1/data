{"name":"Missing 'X-Frame-Options' header","description":"\nClickjacking (User Interface redress attack, UI redress attack, UI redressing)\nis a malicious technique of tricking a Web user into clicking on something different\nfrom what the user perceives they are clicking on, thus potentially revealing\nconfidential information or taking control of their computer while clicking on\nseemingly innocuous web pages.\n\nThe server didn't return an `X-Frame-Options` header which means that this website\ncould be at risk of a clickjacking attack.\n\nThe `X-Frame-Options` HTTP response header can be used to indicate whether or not\na browser should be allowed to render a page inside a frame or iframe. Sites can\nuse this to avoid clickjacking attacks, by ensuring that their content is not\nembedded into other sites.\n","references":{"MDN":"https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/X-Frame-Options","RFC":"http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7034","OWASP":"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Clickjacking"},"cwe":693,"severity":"low","remedy_guidance":"\nConfigure your web server to include an X-Frame-Options header.\n"}
