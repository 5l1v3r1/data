    "description": "\nConcurrent Version System (CVS) and Subversion (SVN) provide a method for\napplication developers to control different versions of their code.\n\nOccasionally, the developer's version or user information can be stored incorrectly\nwithin the code and may be visible to the end user (either in the HTML or code\ncomments). As one of the initial steps in information gathering, cyber-criminals\nwill spider a website and using automated methods attempt to discover any CVS/SVN\ninformation that may be present in the page.\n\nThis will aid them in developing a better understanding of the deployed\napplication (potentially through the disclosure of version information), or it\nmay assist in further information gathering or social engineering attacks.\n\nUsing the same automated methods, Arachni was able to detect CVS or SVN details\nstored within the affected page.\n",
