{"name":"CAPTCHA protected form","description":"\nTo prevent the automated abuse of a page, applications can implement what is\nknown as a CAPTCHA.\n\nThese are used to ensure human interaction with the application and are often\nused on forms where the application conducts sensitive actions. These typically\ninclude user registration, or submitting emails via \"Contact Us\" pages etc.\n\nArachni has flagged this not as a vulnerability, but as a prompt for the\npenetration tester to conduct further manual testing on the CAPTCHA function, as\nArachni cannon audit CAPTCHA protected forms.\n\nTesting for insecurely implemented CAPTCHA is a manual process, and an insecurely\nimplemented CAPTCHA could allow a cyber-criminal a means to abuse these sensitive\nactions.\n","severity":"informational","remedy_guidance":"\nAlthough no remediation may be required based on this finding alone, manual\ntesting should ensure that:\n\n1. The server keeps track of CAPTCHA tokens in use and has the token terminated\n    after its first use or after a period of time. Therefore preventing replay attacks.\n2. The CAPTCHA answer is not hidden in plain text within the response that is\n    sent to the client.\n3. The CAPTCHA image should not be weak and easily solved.\n"}
