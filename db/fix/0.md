Do not keep obsolete versions of directories under the virtual web
server root.

When updating the site, delete or move the directories
to a directory outside the virtual root, edit them there, and move (or
copy) the directories back to the virtual root. Make sure that only
the directories that are actually in use reside under the virtual
root.

Preventing access without authentication may also be an option
and stop a client being able to view the contents of a directory,
however it is still likely that the filenames will be able to be
discovered.

Using obscure filenames is only implementing security
through obscurity and is not a recommended option.
