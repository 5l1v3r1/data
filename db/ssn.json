    "remedy_guidance": "\nInitially, the SSN within the response should be checked to ensure its validity,\nas it is possible that the regular expression has matched a similar number with\nno relation to a real SSN.\n\nIf the response does contain a valid SSN, then all efforts should be taken to\nremove or further protect this information. This can be achieved by removing the\nSSN altogether or by masking the number so that only the last few digits are\npresent within the response (eg. _**********123_).\n",
