    "description": "\nThe browser security model normally prevents web content from one domain from\naccessing data from another domain. This is commonly known as the \"same origin policy\".\n\nURL policy files grant cross-domain permissions for reading data. They permit\noperations that are not permitted by default. The URL policy file for Silverlight\nis located, by default, in the root directory of the target server, with the name\n`crossdomain.xml` (for example, at `www.example.com/crossdomain.xml`).\n\nWhen a domain is specified in `crossdomain.xml`, the site declares that it\nis willing to allow the operators of any servers in that domain to obtain any\ndocument on the server where the policy file resides.\n\nThe `crossdomain.xml` file deployed on this website opens the server to all\ndomains (use of a single asterisk \"*\" as a pure wildcard is supported).\n",
