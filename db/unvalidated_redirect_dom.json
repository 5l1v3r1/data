{"name":"Unvalidated DOM redirect","description":"\nWeb applications occasionally use DOM input values to store the address of the\npage to which the client will be redirected -- for example:\n`yoursite.com/#/?redirect=www.yoursite.com/404.asp`\n\nAn unvalidated redirect occurs when the client is able to modify the affected\nparameter value and thus control the location of the redirection.\nFor example, the following URL `yoursite.com/#/?redirect=www.anothersite.com`\nwill redirect to `www.anothersite.com`.\n\nCyber-criminals will abuse these vulnerabilities in social engineering attacks\nto get users to unknowingly visit malicious web sites.\n\nArachni has discovered that the web page does not validate the parameter value prior\nto redirecting the client to the injected value.\n","references":{"OWASP Top 10 2010":"https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Top_10_2010-A10-Unvalidated_Redirects_and_Forwards"},"tags":["unvalidated","redirect","dom","injection"],"cwe":819,"severity":"medium","remedy_guidance":"\nThe application should ensure that the supplied value for a redirect is permitted.\nThis can be achieved by performing whitelisting on the parameter value.\n\nThe whitelist should contain a list of pages or sites that the application is\npermitted to redirect users to. If the supplied value does not match any value\nin the whitelist then the server should redirect to a standard error page.\n"}
