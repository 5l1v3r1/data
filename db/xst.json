    "description": "\nThe `TRACE` HTTP method allows a client so send a request to the server, and\nhave the same request then send back in the server's response. This allows the\nclient to determine if the server is receiving the request as expected or if\nspecific parts of the request are not arriving as expected.\nFor example incorrect encoding or a load balancer has filtered or changed a value.\nOn many default installations the `TRACE` method is still enabled.\n\nWhile not vulnerable by itself, it does provide a method for cyber-criminals to\nbypass the `HTTPOnly` cookie flag, and therefore could allow a XSS attack to\nsuccessfully access a session token.\n\nThe tool has discovered that the affected page permits the HTTP `TRACE` method.\n",
