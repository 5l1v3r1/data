{"name":"Exposed localstart.asp page","description":"\nTo restrict access to specific pages on a webserver, developers can implement\nvarious methods of authentication, therefore only allowing access to clients\nwith valid credentials.\nThere are several forms of authentication that can be used. The simplest forms of\nauthentication are known as 'Basic' and 'Basic Realm'.\nThese methods of authentication have several known weaknesses such as being\nsusceptible to brute force attacks.\n\nAdditionally, when utilising the NTLM mechanism in a windows environment, several\ndisclosures of information exist, and any brute force attack occurs against the\nserver's local users, or domain users if the web server is a domain member.\n\nCyber-criminals will attempt to locate protected pages to gain access to them\nand also perform brute force attacks to discover valid credentials.\n\nArachni discovered the following page requires NTLM based basic authentication\nin order to be accessed.\n","tags":["asp","iis","server"],"severity":"low","remedy_guidance":"\nIf the pages being protected are not required for the functionality of the web\napplication they should be removed, otherwise, it is recommended that basic\nand basic realm authentication are not used to protect against pages requiring\nauthentication.\n\nIf NTLM based basic authentication must be used, then default server and domain\naccounts such as `administrator` and `root` should be disabled, as these will\nundoubtedly be the first accounts to be targeted in any such attack.\n\nAdditionally, the webserver should not be joined to any corporate domain where\nusernames are readily available (such as from email addresses). If the pages are\nrequired, and it is possible to remove the basic authentication, then a stronger\nand more resilient form-based authentication mechanism should be implemented to\nprotect the affected pages.\n"}
